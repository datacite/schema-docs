.. contents:: :local:


ContactPerson
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Person with knowledge of how to access, troubleshoot, or otherwise field issues related to the resource.

**Usage Notes:** May also be the “Point of Contact” in an organisation that controls access to the resource, if that organisation is different from the Publisher, Distributor, and Data Manager.


DataCollector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** erson/institution responsible for finding or gathering/collecting data under the guidelines of the author(s) or Principal Investigator (PI).

**Usage Notes:** May also be used when crediting survey conductors, interviewers, event or condition observers, or persons responsible for monitoring key instrument data.


DataCurator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Person tasked with reviewing, enhancing, cleaning, or standardizing metadata and the associated data submitted for storage, use, and maintenance within a data centre or repository.

**Usage Notes:** While the DataManager is concerned with digital maintenance, the DataCurator’s role encompasses quality assurance focused on content and metadata. DataCurator responsibilities include: checking completeness of the submitted dataset against the content as described by the submitter; verifying standard metadata according to the applicable system or schema; adding or verifying specialized metadata to add value and ensure access across disciplines; and determining how the metadata might map to search engines, database products, and automated feeds.

Repository managers as well as data librarians working in the repository fall within this category.

Example: https://doi.org/10.20375/0000-000D-1D1F-2


DataManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Person (or organisation with a staff of data managers, such as a data centre) responsible for maintaining the finished resource.

**Usage Notes:** The work done by this person or organisation ensures that the resource is periodically “refreshed” in terms of software/hardware support, is kept available or is protected from unauthorized access, is stored in accordance with industry standards, and is handled in accordance with the records management requirements applicable to it.

Example: https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/41b3ed2e152e1e4c3846e646118208e7

**Usage Notes:** Works stored in more than one archive/repository may credit each as a distributor.


Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** A person who oversees the details related to the publication format of the resource.

**Usage Notes:** Note: if the Editor is to be credited in place of multiple creators, the Editor’s name may be supplied as Creator, with “(Ed.)” appended to the name.


HostingInstitution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Typically, the organisation allowing the resource to be available on the internet through the provision of its hardware/software/operating support.

**Usage Notes:** This role normally falls on the University, research center or organization where the data center/data repository belongs.

EXAMPLE: Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA)

May also be used for an organisation that stores the data offline - often a data centre if that data centre is not the “publisher” of the resource.


Producer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Typically, a person or organisation responsible for the artistry and form of a media product.

**Usage Notes:** In the data industry, this may be a company “producing” DVDs that package data for future dissemination by a distributor.


ProjectLeader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Person officially designated as head of project team or sub- project team instrumental in the work necessary to development of the resource.

**Usage Notes:** The Project Leader is not “removed” from the work that resulted in the resource; he or she remains intimately involved throughout the life of the particular project team.


ProjectManager

**Usage Notes:** The manager of a project normally has more administrative responsibility than actual work involvement.

**Usage Notes:** This vocabulary may or may not indicate the quality, quantity, or substance of the person’s involvement.


RegistrationAgency

RegistrationAuthority

**Usage Notes:** The IDF serves as the Registration Authority for the International Standards Organisation (ISO) in the area/domain of Digital Object Identifiers.


RelatedPerson

**Usage Notes:** This person could be an author’s intellectual mentor, a person providing intellectual leadership in the discipline or subject domain, etc.


Researcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** A person involved in analysing data or the results of an experiment or formal study. May indicate an intern or assistant to one of the authors who helped with research but who was not so “key” as to be listed as an author.

**Usage Notes:** Should be a person, not an institution. Note that a person involved in the gathering of data would fall under the contributorType “DataCollector.” The researcher may find additional data online and correlate it to the data collected for the experiment or study, for example.


ResearchGroup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Description:** Typically refers to a group of individuals with a lab, department, or division that has a specifically defined focus of activity.

**Usage Notes:** May operate at a narrower level of scope; may or may not hold less administrative responsibility than a project team.
