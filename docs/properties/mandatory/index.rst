*Guidance for handling missing mandatory property values*

If providing values for any of the mandatory properties presents a difficulty, use of standard machine - recognizable codes is strongly advised. A set of the codes is provided in :doc:`/appendices/appendix_3`. However, we recommend that you consider the resulting effect on the citation created from the metadata provided.

Here is an example of a citation that uses machine-readable substitutions for all but one of the required metadata properties. Obviously the more metadata that is supplied, the more information is conveyed. Note that this is a demonstration DOI and not an actual identifier, so the link will not work. ::
