About DataCite
=====================================

`DataCite <https://datacite.org/>`_ is a leading global non-profit organisation that provides Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for research data and other research outputs. Organizations within the research community join DataCite as members to be able to assign DOIs to all their research outputs. This way, their outputs become discoverable and associated metadata is made available to the community.

Scholarly research is producing ever-increasing amounts of digital research data and it depends on data
to verify research findings, create new research, and share findings. In this context, what has been
missing until recently is a *persistent* approach to access, identification, sharing, and re-use of datasets. To
address this need, DataCite was founded in late 2009 with these three
fundamental goals:

* establish easier access to scientific research data on the Internet,
* increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable contributions to the scientific record, and
* support data archiving that will permit results to be verified and re-purposed for future study.

DataCite Community Participation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Metadata Working Group would like to acknowledge the contributions to our work of many
colleagues in our institutions who provided assistance of all kinds. Their help has been greatly
appreciated. In addition, we are indebted to numerous individuals and organisations in the broader
scholarly community who have taken an interest in this work. Because data citation and data management are evolving areas of interest, we look forward to continued feedback and participation.
