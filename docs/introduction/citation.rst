Citation
=====================================

Because many users of this schema are members of a variety of academic disciplines, DataCite remains
discipline-agnostic concerning matters pertaining to academic style sheet requirements. Therefore,
DataCite encourages rather than requires a particular citation format. In keeping with this approach, the
following is the *preferred* format for rendering a DataCite citation for human readers using the
mandatory properties of the schema:

   Creator (PublicationYear): Title. Publisher. (resourceTypeGeneral). Identifier

It may also be desirable to include information from optional properties, such as Version. This is
particularly important to include when citing software. For example:

   Creator (PublicationYear): Title. Version. Publisher. (resourceTypeGeneral). Identifier

For citation purposes, DataCite prefers that DOI names are displayed as linkable, permanent URLs, for
example, “https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18”; however, the Identifier may appear in its original
format. If the original format is chosen, be sure to include the characters “doi:" prepended to the
Identifier as in “doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18.”

For resources that do not have a standard publication year value, DataCite recommends that
PublicationYear should include the date that is preferred for use in a citation.
