Citation of dynamic datasets
=====================================

For datasets that are continuously and rapidly updated, there are special challenges both in citation and
preservation. For citation, four approaches are possible:

a) Cite a specific slice [#f1]_ or subset (the set of updates to the dataset made during a particular period of time or to a particular area of the dataset). Example:

  * Data Request T.Jansen; SAHFOS; Work published 2014 via SAHFOS ; Area Def: 54-65°N, 0-45°W. Temporal Def: 1980-2012 (April-August) Taxonomic Def: All zooplankton; (dataset). https://doi.org/10.7487/2014.15.1.1

b) Cite a specific snap-shot [#f1]_ (a copy of the entire dataset made at a specific time). Example:

  * König-Langlo, G., & Sieger, R. (2010). BSRN snapshot 2010-01 as ISO image file (3.75 GB) [Data set]. PANGAEA - Data Publisher for Earth & Environmental Science. (dataset). https://doi.org/10.1594/pangaea.833424

c) Cite the continuously updated dataset [#f1]_ but add an Access Date and Time to the citation. Example:

  * Doe, J. and R. Roe. 2001. The FOO Data Set. Version 2.3. The FOO Data Center. (dataset). https://doi.org/10.xxxx/notfoo.547983. Accessed 1 May 2011.

d) Cite a query [#f2]_, time-stamped for re-execution against a versioned database. The RDA recommended citation for this approach is:

  * R\. Roe. 2017. "The Moo Data Query" created at 2017-07-21 10:25:30 PID https://doi.org/10.xxxx/notmoo.857988. Subset of Moo Database (dataset). PID https://doi.org/10.xxxx/bigmoo.360873.

Notes:
  The “slice,” “snap‐shot” and "query" options require unique identifiers. Be aware that the third
  option (c) necessarily means that following the citation does not result in access to the resource
  as cited. This limits reproducibility of the work that uses this form of citation.
  In addition, please note that access date and time may be combined with the first (a), second (b)
  and fourth (d) options, but it must be used with the third option (c).

  The fourth option (d) may shift more work onto repositories to store database versions for all
  the queries, so not all repositories will be able to support this alternative.
